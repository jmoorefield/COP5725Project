Prerequisites: 
---------------------  
```
Working version of Java, Visual Studio Code, and JGraphT and GSON libraries:  
JGraphT is needed for creating the graphs, traversing them, and heavy path decomposition. GSON is needed for JSON processing. Both are available in this repository in .jar format, and you may also download them with these links:
GSON : https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.10.1
JGraphT : https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgrapht/

To add the libraries, follow the steps below.  
2. Add the jars to your desired directory
3. Open Visual Studio Code
4. Navigate to the "Extensions" tab within Visual Studio Code
5. Type in "Project manager for Java" in the search bar
6. Install "Project Manager for Java"
7. Download INPUT FILES HERE files from our repository
8. Open the files in Visual Studio Code
9. Once the editor with our downloaded code is open, navigate to the "JAVA PROJECTS" tab
10. Expand the "JAVA PROJECTS" tab to reveal the "Referenced Libraries" tab
11. Click the plus "+" button next to "Referenced Libraries"
12. Navigate to the directory where the zipped file was unzipped
13. Within the unzipped folder navigate to jgrapht-1.5.2 > lib > jgrapht-core-1.5.2
14. Add this file to the "Referenced Libraries
15. Now, the jar file jgrapht-core-1.5.2 will be added to the runtime settings
```

We use the dataset Amazon Dataset which can in our GitHub repository in the file titled: INPUT FILE HERE

10. Expand the "JAVA PROJECTS" tab to reveal the "Referenced Libraries" tab
11. Click the plus "+" button next to "Referenced Libraries"
12. Navigate to the directory where the zipped file was unzipped
13. Within the unzipped folder navigate to jgrapht-1.5.2 > lib > jgrapht-core-1.5.2
14. Add this file to the "Referenced Libraries
15. Now, the jar file jgrapht-core-1.5.2 will be added to the runtime settings
